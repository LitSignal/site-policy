We want to keep GitHub safe for everyone. If you've discovered a security vulnerability in GitHub, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Bounty Program

As a small self-funded startup Litsignal does not have an established bug bounty program. Nevertheless, we'd like to recognize the hard work of researchers that discover vulnerabilities and will consider each report on a case by case basis until we formalize a bounty system. You may report security vulnerabilities on the [Litsignal Security](/contact/security) page.
